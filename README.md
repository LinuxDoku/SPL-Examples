# SPL-Examples
Some (real world) examples for the Standard PHP Library which is shipped with every PHP
installation but only used by less persons. Maybe cause the doc's are not the 
best, so we gonna change this.

## Can I run these examples?
Yes. Every example is runnable out of the box. You only have to clone this repo
to your computer an run it. Browser or cli, what you want.

For example to run the Countable Interface example on my debian machine:

    git clone https://github.com/LinuxDoku/SPL-Examples.git
	cd SPL-Examples
    php Interfaces/Countable.php
